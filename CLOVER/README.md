## Introduction

----

STATUS - this repo is no longer updated as I've switched to a P52s. I did have success booting a P52s initially with the content of this repo. Subsequent tweaks for that machine are stored at <https://github.com/kk1987/P52s-hackintosh> which might be a better reference for P52s/T580/T480 due to the hardware similarity (most notably T480s seems to use a different TrackPad/TrackPoint implementation.)

----


This repo is my notes and configuration files for my hackintosh (10.14-10.14.1 Mojave) installation on a Thinkpad T480s. It's originally posted at <https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/success-macos-10-14-on-thinkpad-t480s.261318/>.

The Clover files in this repo (config.plist + ACPI/patched/ + kexts/Other/ + drivers64UEFI) _in theory_ should boot macOS 10.14, installer or post-install, on any T480s. It may work on similar laptops like T480/T580/P52s too. ~~There's absolutely zero guarantee though, since I never tested on a different machine.~~ Verified working on my P52s.

For initial booting, it might be necessary to inject an invalid ig-platform-id like 0x12344321. Subsequent boots should be fine without.

## Basic Info

### Hardware (OEM):

* i5 8250U CPU, Intel UHD 620 (no dGPU)
* 1080p screen w/ touch (IVO R140NWF5 R6, w/ ELAN USB touchscreen built-in)
* Realtek ALC3287 ("ALC257")
* Intel Ethernet I219-V
* Synaptics TrackPoint + ELAN TrackPad
* Synaptics Fingerprint Reader

### Hardware (upgraded/replaced):

* 24GB RAM (8G onboard + 16G SODIMM, DDR4)
* ADATA SX8200 960GB NVMe SSD
* BCM94352Z M.2 WiFi + BT (card is E-key while mobo slot is A-key; mechanically modified with knife/file to fit)

### UEFI Settings:

* Current: UEFI Firmware version 1.26
  * "Thunderbolt BIOS Assist": disable (default) to make front type-C port work in macOS; enable to reduce idle power consumption in Linux
* Static / partial-hotpatch ACPI files before `d6dd12a` were patched against UEFI version 1.25, all ports/devices enabled (default), and "Thunderbolt BIOS Assist" enabled

### Partitioning & other OSes:

I did a tri-boot setup with installation order as follows:

* macOS -> Windows 10 -> Arch Linux (Antergos)

## Status

### Working
* most features do work
  * Keyboard & TrackPoint/TrackPad (as mouse)
  * Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth
  * Screen brightness & brightness shortcut keys
  * Basic audio including speaker, internal mic, headphone jack
  * Touchscreen
  * Camera
  * Card reader
  * All USB ports
  * HDMI video port, with audio
  * USB type-C video output, with audio
  * Sleep/resume (takes 25-30s to sleep)
  * Thunderbolt (as long as you didn't enable "Thunderbolt BIOS Assist")

### Limited functionality

* HID: No multi-touch/scrolling; both TrackPad and TrackPoint function as PS/2 mouse
  * [Smart Scroll](http://www.marcmoini.com/sx_en.html) can be used to emulate mid-button TrackPoint scrolling (enable "Vector Scroll" with "Drag Button 3")
  * Alternatively, multi-touch trackpad can be enabled using patched ELAN driver found at <https://github.com/linusyang92/macOS-ThinkPad-T480s> (requires disabling TrackPoint in UEFI though)
* Audio
  * (I don't see why it's ever needed but) there's no external mic support
  * "out of the box" headphone sound may be glitchy. Disabling "Use ambient noise reduction" in Settings -> Sound -> Input seems to fix this
  * DP/HDMI audio output via USB type-C: it works, but compatibility may be limited. I have an Apple type-C to HDMI adapter that works, and a StarTek type-C to DP cable that doesn't. Both work on a real MacBook, obviously
  * Alternatively, VoodooHDA can be used. It supports enternal mic via combo jack (without auto-switching) but doesn't support HDMI audio. Configuration in `Info.plist` need to be updated with `iGain=0, PCM=100, Rec=50`
* Display
  * HiDPI can be enabled using <https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi> but there will be the glitch-after-wake issue, which cannot be solved by the EDID patching provided by one-key-hidpi script (the patch sets panel depth as 8-bit and will cause a blank screen on boot on my FHD touch panel)

### Not Working / Untested

* Fingerprint reader (no driver)
* BT Handover etc. (untested)

## Clover UEFI Setup

### Clover

* Verified working with sf.net versions r4658, r4674

### drivers64UEFI

* ApfsDriverLoader-64
* NvmExpressDxe-64
* AptioMemoryFix-64 (or OsxAptioFixDrv-64 + EmuVariableUefi-64)

### config.plist

* (archived in this repo)

### kexts

I put all extra kexts under EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other.

* FakeSMC (w/ all plugins), for Hackintosh to boot
* ACPIBatteryManager, for battery status
* AppleBacklightFixup, for brightness
* AppleALC + CodecCommander, for audio
* Lilu, for various stuff below to work
* WhateverGreen, for iGPU
  * See Devices/Properties patches in config.plist (set ig-platform-id & device-id + patch for 32MB DVMT-prealloc)
* USBInjectAll, for USB ports
  * Touchscreen, Bluetooth etc. won't work without this
  * See SSDT-UIAC.dsl for machine-specific patch
* VoodooPS2Controller, for keyboard/touchpad/trackpad
* IntelMausiEthernet, for Ethernet
* AirportBrcmFixup, for WiFi; BrcmFirmwareData + BrcmPatchRAM2, for Bluetooth
  * Refer to toledo's [guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/broadcom-wifi-bluetooth-guide.242423/)

## ACPI Patching

* Based on RehabMan's [guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-patching-laptop-dsdt-ssdts.152573/)
* Current: "Full Hotpatch" configuration (most SSDTs taken from linusyang92's [repo](https://github.com/linusyang92/macOS-ThinkPad-T480s))
* Commit `a95dec1`: "Partial Hotpatch" configuration (patched DSDT & add-on SSDTs in ACPI/patched)
  * This likely won't work with different hardware specs, or even different UEFI versions/settings
  * See git changelog for details. (Mostly just FYI which patches are needed)
